## Usage

The project provides grunt commands for most tasks.
Check the Gruntfile.js to view available tasks.
Some of the most useful are:

#### grunt builddev
Completely builds a development version of the app, on the app/dev folder.

#### grunt buildrel

#### grunt watchjs, grunt watchhtml
These tasks will watch the app/src folder for changes, and automatically build
the development folder. See the grunt file for more details.
